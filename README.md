# World Time App

The World Time App is a simple and intuitive application that allows users to view the current time in different cities worldwide. It is built with Flutter and utilizes World Time API to fetch accurate and up-to-date time data from various locations globally.

## Features

- View Current Time: Users can quickly check the current time for multiple cities in different time zones.
- Day/Night Indication: The app visually indicates whether it is day or night in each city.
- Timezone Conversion: Users can convert the time between different time zones. They can select a city as the source timezone and another city as the destination timezone to see the corresponding time conversion.

## Acknowledgements
